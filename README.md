# Apex Legends Internal

An internal cheat for Apex Legends that hooks the D3D11 Present Scene to render.

## Problems

Some functions are flagged as well I've removed my hooking library, you can add [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).

## Usage

1. Change the driver inside of any public kernel injector ([Face Injector](https://github.com/ALEHACKsp/face-injector-v2-1/tree/main/face_injector_v2) or [Modmap](https://github.com/btbd/modmap/tree/master/modmap))
2.  Compile in `x64 Release` & inject.

## Note

Using any public injector will get you banned, even if you change the driver.  
I wrote this 8 - 9 months ago when my knowledge on Internals was very rough & my C++ sucked.
